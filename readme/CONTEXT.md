Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was created to cover the need for companies to communicate with their customers directly and effectively via SMS, without leaving the Odoo environment. It allows end-users and marketing teams to manage campaigns, send transactional notifications (such as order confirmations or invoice notices), and analyze the results centrally, leveraging the existing data in the ERP.
